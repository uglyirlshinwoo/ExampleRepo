    "In this homework, you will learn how to create and explore a simple, synthetic regression dataset using scikit‐learn’s `make_regression` function. We often use synthetic data to test out our modeling workflows, gain practical experience with various models, and observe how noise, training set size, and other factors affect model performance, as measured by the Mean Squared Error (MSE). By controlling the dataset generation, we can see precisely how well the model approximates the dataset parameters, and you’ll practice splitting data into training and testing sets to estimate how well the model will generalize to unseen data. This will give you insight into how regression models behave under different conditions (such as varying amounts of training data) and help you interpret outcomes with appropriate metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some problems you will need to do a bit of research in `sklearn`'s documentation. The functions we are using are very common in ML, and it will be well worth the time you spend reading through the documentation and looking at the examples provided there. \n",

    "As I mentioned in the first Live Session, some things I will ask you do to are not graded; I expect you to do them just as thoroughly as the answers which will be graded.  To skip the non-graded parts\n",

    "This is the last homework in which you will get instant feedback on all your solutions; since Gradescope is not set up for this, we have used the Otter auto-grader to allow immediate feedback in this notebook. After each cell in which you assign a value to a variable such as a1a etc. there is a cell which will check your solution. Therefore, you may test your solutions as much as you wish before submitting to Gradescope. Starting with HW 03, you will continue to have graded and ungraded problems, but you will not receive feedback on the graded parts until after the late submission period is over. "
