    "## Homework 01: First Steps with Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework will introduce you to foundational techniques in downloading and setting up datasets, running `sklearn` models, and examining their results. The primary goal is to establish the workflow for accessing and submitting assignments, writing basic code, and interpreting outputs. This assignment will also help us test the autograder and ensure that feedback mechanisms work seamlessly.\n",

    "### Submission Instructions via Gradescope\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Gradescope for homework submissions this term. Please follow these instructions carefully:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Do not rename the file**  \n",
    "   - Renaming the notebook (**`Homework_01.ipynb`**) will cause the autograder to fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Include the `requirements.txt` file**  \n",
    "   - Download both **`Homework_01.ipynb`** and `requirements.txt` from the GitHub repository.  \n",
    "   - The `requirements.txt` file specifies the dependencies (imported libraries) required for grading.  \n",
    "   - **Do not modify this file** unless explicitly instructed by the LFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify before submission**  \n",
    "   - Before submitting, run `Restart Kernel and Run All` to ensure that all cells execute without errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Submitting to Gradescope**  \n",
    "   - You should have received an email inviting you to join Gradescope. If not, please contact us immediately.  \n",
    "   - Log in to [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com), navigate to your dashboard, and locate **Homework 01**.  \n",
    "   - Drag and drop the following files into the upload section:\n",
    "     - **`Homework_01.ipynb`**\n",
    "     - `requirements.txt`\n",
    "   - Or, you may zip up a folder containing these two files and submit that.\n",
    "   - Click `Upload` to submit your files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Review your submission**  \n",
    "   - You will receive the autograder results and a confirmation email after submission.  \n",
    "   - For the first two homeworks, **multiple resubmissions** will be allowed. Use this opportunity to get your debugging and submission workflow established.   \n",
    "   - Starting from Homework 03, **only one submission will be permitted.** You will need to ensure that your work is complete and carefully verified before uploading."
